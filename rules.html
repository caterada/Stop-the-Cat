					This will be a game where you will have to stop your cat from climbing
					the stairs and getting to your food.
				</p>
				<p>
					You are not home, and looking into the cat cam. You have a gate at the
					top of the stairs that can close remotely via an app. However, in
					order to activate it, it needs to check that you are human by making
					you guess a random five letter word… you are questioning if this gate
					was worth the $30 you spent, but that’s another story.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyways, you must guess the random five letter word. You may guess one
					letter at a time, and every incorrect guess gets the cat up one flight
					of stairs. If the cat climbs six flights of stairs, the cat eats your
					delicious food you were saving for when you got home. If you guess the
					word correctly, the gate closes and your food is safe.
